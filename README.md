# mini-projects

This includes: 
- a simple encryption and decryption tool
- a simple "safe" login page
  - website writes to a database and encrypts password
  - to improve I need to:
      - fix some bugs within the website
      - create a better success page
      - use a stronger encryption method for the password
      - add password requirements
      - encrypt the connection between the page and database
