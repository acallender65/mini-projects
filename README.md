# mini-projects

This includes: 
- a simple encryption and decryption tool - correct version uploaded now 
  - to improve I need to:
      - Add the rest of the ciphers - vignere cipher, playfair cipher, diffie hellman and elgamal cipher not added yet 
- a simple "safe" login page
  - website writes to a database and encrypts password
  - the website works on your pc if downloaded and/or ran in vscode
  - to improve I need to:
      - put the website on github pages so that it can be accessed properly
      - fix some bugs within the website
      - create a better success page
      - use a stronger encryption method for the password
      - add password requirements
      - encrypt the connection between the page and database
